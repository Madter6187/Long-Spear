# Long Spear
My Game source code

for Sprites, I would not give any sprites because it is my work and I don't want to get annoying when someone stole my arts

for Background, I get it from itch.io, here the source : https://free-game-assets.itch.io/nature-landscapes-free-pixel-art

for Tilemap, I get it from Pixel Frog(itch.io), here the source : https://pixelfrog-assets.itch.io/pixel-adventure-1

for Sound effects, you can download it in this repository
